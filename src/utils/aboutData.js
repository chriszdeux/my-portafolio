  about_me: `
  I'm a person who likes to solve things, I like technology but I would like to focus on Blockchain, I think we should all learn a little bit of programming basics, you can apply it to real life.

  Why did I choose this career? It's easy to answer, technology advances in giant steps. In 2011 I was studying Video Game Engineering and that was where I first learned a little about web technologies.
  Back then I learned basics about html, css, bootstrap and foundation. For personal reasons I had to stop my studies and that was where I made my first mistake of moving away from programming.
  
  From 2011 to 2020 I tried to learn several things on my own, see what I could specialize in? I tried from graphic design, video editing, photography, music and even tried to make a gamer brand, but none of this felt like it was for me.
  At the beginning of the pandemic I was forced to give up many things, but it also completely opened my eyes and that's when I decided to take front-end  development as my career and learn about personal finance.
  
  When I saw how many technologies were available to develop web, I honestly felt overwhelmed, I felt that I couldn't anymore, but I had no other option, it was to learn or go back to work as a doordash delivery.
  
  Throughout 2021 I tried to learn, not just watching videos trying to follow in the footsteps of the master, I dedicated myself to really learning the technologies.
  
  I know that I can be an important member of a team, if I am assigned a task I'll do it`,

  work_experience: `I still don't have experience in the field, however when I carried out my projects I learned a lot.
  In each project I found a different way of working, I was adding more and more functions and getting more and more errors for which I give thanks for Dev-Tools.`,
