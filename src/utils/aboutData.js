  about_me: `I am a front end developer focusing on React. My first contact in  web development was in 2011 when I was studying video game development engineering, which I only studied for a year and a half, for personal reasons I could not continue.
  In this school I had the opportunity to learn about technologies such as C++, Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator Unreal Engine 3, html, css, bootstrap and foundation.
  A little over a year and a half ago I resumed development and chose front end as my career..`,
